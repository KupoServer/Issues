# Kupo Server Issue Tracker

Welcome to the Kupo server issue tracker. This is where we manage any bugs/issues that players may come across while playing on the server. This tracker helps us keep an organized list of what needs to be fixed, reviewed, looked into etc. to ensure the server is as close to bug free as possible.

**Please note:** Because we are partially version locked, bugs should **NOT** be submitted to DarkStars official tracker. Bugs reported from this server will be ignored as we are considered old/outdated.

## Lost Item Reports

In the event that you lose an item due to auto-sorting treasure pool bugs with DarkStar, you **MUST** provide a screenshot as proof the item was lost. The screenshot must show the line that the item was lost / did not meet the requirements, and you must also have `/clock` in the screenshot to provide proof of the date.

I will not restore items that are lost due to your own mistakes such as zoning before lotting, forgetting to lot on an item before its auto-sorted, etc. This is strictly for restoring items that are lost due to bugs.

## Exploit Reports

If you have found an exploit or other major bug that can result in unfair advantages or similar, please **DO NOT** report them here. 

Instead, exploits should be sent to atom0s via a private message on our forums here:<br/>

## Issue Report Template

When you open a new issue on this tracker, a template will automatically fill in the input field that you can submit information with. 

Please **DO NOT** remove the template. Instead, simply fill it out like its a survey/test. It is important that you follow the template otherwise your issue may be locked due to not following the rules. The template allows us to gather as much information as needed from you that you may not think of when reporting a bug.
